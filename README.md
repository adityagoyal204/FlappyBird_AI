Flappy_Bird_AI using Neat Algo

Introduction

The main aim of this project is to develop a Genetic Algorithm based approach for constructing an AI which can play the Flappy Bird game much more efficient as compared to a normal human being.

Flappy Bird is a game where the player tries to make the bird cross the maximum number of pillars while itâ€™s alive. If the bird hits any pillar, or the ground, it dies and the game ends. Pillars can come up randomly and can have variable heights. The player has 2 moves : first, to make the bird move up, and the second to not do anything, and consequently let the bird fall downwards to the ground. The player tries to navigate the bird safely through the maximum possible number of pillars. Each pillar crossed successfully adds 1 to the score.

Genetic Algorithms are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. As such they represent an intelligent exploitation of a random search used to solve optimization problems. Although ran- domised,these are by no means random, instead they exploit historical information to direct the search into the region of better performance within the search space. The basic techniques of these are designed to simulate processes in natural systems necessary for evolution, specially those follow the principles first laid down by Charles Darwin of survival of the fittest. Since in nature, competition among individuals for scanty resources results in the fittest individuals dominating over the weaker ones.(https: //www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol1/hmw/article1.html)

Genetic Algorithms allow us to explore a space of parameters to find solutions that score well according to a fitness function. They are a way to implement function optimization: given a function g(x) (where x is typically a vector of parameter values), find the value of x that maximizes (or minimizes) g(x).(http://theory.stanford.edu/ ~amitp/GameProgramming/AITechniques.html)
